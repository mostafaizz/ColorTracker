## Introduction

This C++ code is an implementation of the visual tracking method proposed in [1]. The implementation is based on the Matlab code provided by the authors of the paper.
The implementation in C++ using openCV was done by Mostafa Izz.

## Compile

Pre-requirements: 

- C++ compiler with C++11 support
- OpenCV 2.4 development files
- CMake 2.8.3+

```bash
# download/clone the repo
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ make
```

## Demo Run

```bash
$ cd ColorTracker
$ ./build/demo-video
```

## API

There are two interfaces provided in the code in class "color_tracker"
1) cv::Rect track_frame(cv::Mat &current_frame)
Provided to track frame by frame
So, the parameters needed to be passed to the constructor are used for intializing the bounding box only.
2) void track_video(double start_second = 0, double end_second = 0)
Provided to track video
In the second case the video path should be provided in the parameters passed to the constructor.

There are examples on both interfaces in the file `demo-video.cpp`
There is a simple example in the file `demo-vot.cpp` for usage with the VOT challenge.

The code was tested under two environments:

1- Windows 7 using visual studio 2013 with openCV 2.4.9
2- Ubuntu 14.04 with GCC 4.8.2 with openCV 2.4.9
